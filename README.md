# theShallot #

This is a copycat webpage of the Onion's home page. I built all my css using Sass; the naming convention is BEM. Since there are so many images of disparate aspect ratios, I altered them down to 16:9 (and 4:3 alternatively) using css padding. I additionally made the Shallot logo in Inkscape. The main bits of Javascript here are the article reel, the search bar click event, the hamburger menu, the tab switches inside the modal triggered by the hamburger menu, and the modal that appears when the user clicks on the user icon at the top right of the the page. This webpage is also accessible via tabbing and ARIA attributes.

I uploaded everything via git, and I also utilized Gulp to autoprefix, minify code, compress images, compile sass, browser-sync, etc.
