# theShallot #

This is a copycat webpage of the Onion's home page. I built all my css using Sass; the naming convention is BEM. Since there are so many images of disparate aspect ratios, I altered them down to 16:9 (and 4:3 alternatively) using css padding. The article links don't lead anywhere, but I mimicked all of the button interactivity from the Onion's site: the article reel hover event, the search bar that expands on click, the dropdown nav menu (here changed to a click event for better accessibility), the hamburger menu and the resultant modal toggler, the modal that appears when the user clicks on the user icon at the top right of the the page, the focus trap that is triggered within the modals, the fixed top menu that appears when the user scrolls down to the email address input, etc. This webpage is also accessible via tabbing and ARIA attributes.

I uploaded everything via git, and I also utilized Gulp to autoprefix, minify code, compress images, compile sass, babel, browser-sync, etc. The Shallot logo was made with Inkscape, and the favicon was generated via realfavicongenerator.net.
